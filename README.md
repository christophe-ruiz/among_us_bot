As of today (v0.1) the bot can solve the wiring task in Among Us.

Run the bot with the executable or script (requirements in pipfile and requirements.txt) then open the wiring mini-game and 
simply press the UP arrow key to quickly solve it.

The bot may not be functional on every screen resolution.

The script requires Pynput and Pillow libraries.
